# SVG-logo-maker

The purpose of this project was to create a simple CLI application to generate basic ```.svg``` files. Upon running the application via ```node index.js```, you will be prompted to enter up to 3 characters, select a text color, select a shape, and select a shape color. The application will automatically generate an SVG file for you with your selections and save it as ```new.svg``` in the examples folder.
